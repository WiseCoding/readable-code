# Readable Code

# Assignment 📝

> Imagine: during your internship, you get handed an existing project to maintain.
> You try to read into the project, but there's no readme, you see variables like $a or $dontChangeThis and the last developer with project knowledge just left.
> You wouldn't wish that to anyone, would you? Now, let's see what we can do to prevent this from happening with a focus on readability!
